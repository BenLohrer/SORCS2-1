4 (of 4) markers to be included from [ SORCS2_CM.map ]
Reading pedigree information from [ SORCS2_CM.fam ] 
8848 individuals read from [ SORCS2_CM.fam ] 
8848 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
3870 cases, 4978 controls and 0 missing
3737 males, 5111 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
8848 founders and 0 non-founders found
4 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ SORCS2_CM.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
After filtering, 3870 cases, 4978 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 3737 males, 5111 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
