4 (of 4) markers to be included from [ ADSP.map ]
Reading pedigree information from [ ADSP.fam ] 
954 individuals read from [ ADSP.fam ] 
954 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
454 cases, 500 controls and 0 missing
400 males, 554 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading 5 covariates from [ ADSPcov.txt ] with nonmissing values for 954 individuals
Selected subset of 3 from 5 covariates
For these, nonmissing covariate values for 954 individuals
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
954 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
After filtering, 454 cases, 500 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 400 males, 554 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing logistic model association results to [ ADSPlogAllCov.assoc.logistic ]
